Introduction of Registry
===========================

The Registry is a stateless, highly scalable server side application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images. It is a storage and content delivery system, holding named Docker images, available in different tagged versions.

Registry ships with a robust notification system, calling webhooks in response to activity, and both extensive logging and reporting, mostly useful for large installations that want to collect metrics.

Features
--------

    You should use the Registry if you want to:

        * Tightly control where your images are being stored
        * Fully own your images distribution pipeline
        * Integrate image storage and distribution tightly into your in-house development workflow
